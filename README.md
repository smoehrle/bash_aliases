# Bash-Config
Convenient access to some shortcuts set in the bash_aliases file. If the file is not
loaded check if a `.bashrc` is present. If `.bashrc` is present but the file is still
not loaded, check the `.profile`.

Minimal samples for `.bashrc` and `.profile` are also present.

## Usage:
```
cd ~ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smoehrle/config/master/.bash_aliases
```
